arch1-Binary-Search-Tree-demo

This directory contains:

code that implements a Binary Search Tree of strings
a demo program that uses it
The demo program reads lines from stdin. Each line is appended onto a Binary Tree. After end-of-file is read, the lines are printed out.

This demo contains the following files: bst.h: header file of tree structure & bst.c: implementation of linked list

To compile:

$ make
To test it, try:

$ make demo
To delete binaries:

$ make clean
Challenges

There are many challenges that I learnt to use the c language line indentation,
Algorithm for example, Binary Search tree Delete algorithm  with String,
because C does not support with string. Moreover, I also learnt to use the
pointers which was more complex term in this project.

Moreover, when I was stucked in this project, I took help from my friends and
also from TA's.
